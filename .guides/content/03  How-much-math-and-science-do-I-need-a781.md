0.3  How much math and science do I need? {#sec4 .section}
-----------------------------------------

I assume that you know what derivatives and integrals are, but that's
about all. In particular, you don't need to know (or remember) much
about finding derivatives or integrals of functions analytically. If you
know the derivative of [x]{style="font-style:italic"}^2^ and you can
integrate
2[x]{style="font-style:italic"} [dx]{style="font-style:italic"}, that
will do it^[2](#note2){#text2}^. More importantly, you should understand
what those concepts *mean*; but if you don't, this book might help you
figure it out.

You don't have to know anything about differential equations.

As for science, we will cover topics from a variety of fields, including
demography, epidemiology, medicine, thermodynamics, and mechanics. For
the most part, I don't assume you know anything about these topics. In
fact, one of the skills you need to do modeling is the ability to learn
enough about new fields to develop models and simulations.

When we get to mechanics, I assume you understand the relationship
between position, velocity, and acceleration, and that you are familiar
with Newton's laws of motion, especially the second law, which is often
expressed as [F]{style="font-style:italic"} =
[ma]{style="font-style:italic"} (force equals mass times acceleration).

I think that's everything you need, but if you find that I left
something out, please let me know.
