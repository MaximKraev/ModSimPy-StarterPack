0.7  Running Jupyter {#sec8 .section}
--------------------

The code for each chapter, and starter code for the exercises, is in
Jupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read
about it at
[[https://jupyter.org]{style="font-family:monospace"}](https://jupyter.org).

To start Jupyter on macOS or Linux, open a Terminal; on Windows, open
Git Bash. Use `cd` to "change directory\" into the code directory in the
repository:

  ------------------
  cd ModSimPy/code
  ------------------

Then launch the Jupyter notebook server:

  ------------------
  jupyter notebook
  ------------------

Jupyter should open a window in a browser, and you should see the list
of notebooks in my repository. Click on the first notebook,
`chap01.ipynb` and follow the instructions to run the first few
"cells\". The first time you run a notebook, it might take several
seconds to start, while some Python files get initialized. After that,
it should run faster.

Feel free to read through the notebook, but it might not make sense
until you read Chapter [1](#chap01).

You can also launch Jupyter from the Start menu on Windows, the Dock on
macOS, or the Anaconda Navigator on any system. If you do that, Jupyter
might start in your home directory or somewhere else in your file
system, so you might have to navigate to find the `ModSimPy` directory.
