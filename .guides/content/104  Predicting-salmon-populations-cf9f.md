10.4  Predicting salmon populations {#sec65 .section}
-----------------------------------

Each year the U.S. Atlantic Salmon Assessment Committee reports
estimates of salmon populations in oceans and rivers in the northeastern
United States. The reports are useful for monitoring changes in these
populations, but they generally do not include predictions.

The goal of this case study is to model year-to-year changes in
population, evaluate how predictable these changes are, and estimate the
probability that a particular population will increase or decrease in
the next 10 years.

As an example, I use data from page 18 of the 2017 report, which
provides population estimates for the Narraguagus and Sheepscot Rivers
in Maine.

In the repository for this book, you'll find a notebook called
`salmon.ipynb` that contains some code to get you started and
instructions.

You should take my instructions as suggestions; if you want to try
something different, please do!
