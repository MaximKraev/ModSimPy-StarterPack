11.1  The Freshman Plague {#sec68 .section}
-------------------------

Every year at Olin College, about 90 new students come to campus from
around the country and the world. Most of them arrive healthy and happy,
but usually at least one brings with them some kind of infectious
disease. A few weeks later, predictably, some fraction of the incoming
class comes down with what we call "The Freshman Plague\".

In this chapter we introduce a well-known model of infectious disease,
the Kermack-McKendrick model, and use it to explain the progression of
the disease over the course of the semester, predict the effect of
possible interventions (like immunization) and design the most effective
intervention campaign.

So far we have done our own modeling; that is, we've chosen physical
systems, identified factors that seem important, and made decisions
about how to represent them. In this chapter we start with an existing
model and reverse-engineer it. Along the way, we consider the modeling
decisions that went into it and identify its capabilities and
limitations.
