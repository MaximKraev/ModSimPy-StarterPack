15.1  The coffee cooling problem {#sec90 .section}
--------------------------------

The coffee cooling problem was discussed by Jearl Walker in [Scientific
American]{style="font-style:italic"} in 1977^[1](#note7){#text7}^; since
then it has become a standard example of modeling and simulation.

Here is my version of the problem:

> Suppose I stop on the way to work to pick up a cup of coffee, which I
> take with milk. Assuming that I want the coffee to be as hot as
> possible when I arrive at work, should I add the milk at the coffee
> shop, wait until I get to work, or add the milk at some point in
> between?

To help answer this question, I made a trial run with the milk and
coffee in separate containers and took some
measurements^[2](#note8){#text8}^:

-   When served, the temperature of the coffee is 90. The volume is
    300mL.
-   The milk is at an initial temperature of 5, and I take about 50mL.
-   The ambient temperature in my car is 22.
-   The coffee is served in a well insulated cup. When I arrive at work
    after 30 minutes, the temperature of the coffee has fallen to 70.
-   The milk container is not as well insulated. After 15 minutes, it
    warms up to 20, nearly the ambient temperature.

To use this data and answer the question, we have to know something
about temperature and heat, and we have to make some modeling decisions.
