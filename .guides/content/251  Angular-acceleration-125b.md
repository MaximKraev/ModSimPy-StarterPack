25.1  Angular acceleration {#sec140 .section}
--------------------------

[]{#hevea_default579} []{#hevea_default580}

Just as linear acceleration is the derivative of velocity, [angular
acceleration]{style="font-weight:bold"} is the derivative of angular
velocity. And just as linear acceleration is caused by force, angular
acceleration is caused by the rotational version of force,
[torque]{style="font-weight:bold"}. If you are not familiar with torque,
you can read about it at
[[https://modsimpy.com/torque]{style="font-family:monospace"}](https://modsimpy.com/torque).

In general, torque is a vector quantity, defined as the [cross
product]{style="font-weight:bold"} of [r]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^
and [F]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^, where
[r]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^ is the [lever
arm]{style="font-weight:bold"}, a vector from the point of rotation to
the point where the force is applied, and
[F]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^ is the vector that represents the
magnitude and direction of the force.

However, for the problems in this chapter, we only need the *magnitude*
of torque; we don't care about the direction. In that case, we can
compute

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  τ = [r]{style="font-style:italic"} [F]{style="font-style:italic"} sinθ 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

where τ is torque, [r]{style="font-style:italic"} is the length of the
lever arm, [F]{style="font-style:italic"} is the magnitude of force, and
θ is the angle between [r]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^ and
[F]{style="font-style:italic"}^→^.

[]{#hevea_default584}

Since torque is the product of a length and a force, it is expressed in
newton meters ().
