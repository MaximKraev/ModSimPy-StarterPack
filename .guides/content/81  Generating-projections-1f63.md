8.1  Generating projections {#sec50 .section}
---------------------------

We'll start with the quadratic model from Section [7.1](#quadratic),
which is based on this update function: []{#hevea_default224}

def update\_func\_quad(pop, t, system): net\_growth = system.alpha \*
pop + system.beta \* pop\*\*2 return pop + net\_growth

As we saw in the previous chapter, we can get the start date, end date,
and initial population from `census`, which is a series that contains
world population estimates generated by the U.S. Census:

t\_0 = get\_first\_label(census) t\_end = get\_last\_label(census) p\_0
= census\[t\_0\]

Now we can create a `System` object: []{#hevea_default225}

system = System(t\_0=t\_0, t\_end=t\_end, p\_0=p\_0, alpha=0.025,
beta=-0.0018)

And run the model:

results = run\_simulation(system, update\_func\_quad)

We have already seen the results in Figure [7.1](#chap03-fig04). Now, to
generate a projection, the only thing we have to change is `t_end`:

system.t\_end = 2250 results = run\_simulation(system,
update\_func\_quad)

Figure [8.1](#chap04-fig01) shows the result, with a projection until
2250. According to this model, population growth will continue almost
linearly for the next 50--100 years, then slow over the following 100
years, approaching 13.9 billion by 2250.

I am using the word "projection\" deliberately, rather than
"prediction\", with the following distinction: "prediction\" implies
something like "this is what we should reasonably expect to happen, at
least approximately\"; "projection\" implies something like "if this
model is actually a good description of what is happening in this
system, and if nothing in the future causes the parameters of the model
to change, this is what would happen.\"

Using "projection\" leaves open the possibility that there are important
things in the real world that are not captured in the model. It also
suggests that, even if the model is good, the parameters we estimate
based on the past might be different in the future.

The quadratic model we've been working with is based on the assumption
that population growth is limited by the availability of resources; in
that scenario, as the population approaches carrying capacity, birth
rates fall and death rates rise because resources become scarce.

[]{#hevea_default226}

If that assumption is valid, we might be able to use actual population
growth to estimate carrying capacity, especially if we observe the
transition into the regime where the growth rate starts to fall.

But in the case of world population growth, those conditions don't
apply. Over the last 50 years, the net growth rate has leveled off, but
not yet started to fall, so we don't have enough data to make a credible
estimate of carrying capacity. And resource limitations are probably
*not* the primary reason growth has slowed. As evidence, consider:

-   First, the death rate is not increasing; rather, it has declined
    from 1.9% in 1950 to 0.8% now (see
    [[https://modsimpy.com/mortality]{style="font-family:monospace"}](https://modsimpy.com/mortality)).
    So the decrease in net growth is due entirely to declining birth
    rates.

    []{#hevea_default227}

-   Second, the relationship between resources and birth rate is the
    opposite of what the model assumes; as nations develop and people
    become more wealthy, birth rates tend to fall.

    []{#hevea_default228}

We should not take too seriously the idea that this model can estimate
carrying capacity. But the predictions of a model can be credible even
if the assumptions of the model are not strictly true. For example,
population growth might behave *as if* it is resource limited, even if
the actual mechanism is something else.

In fact, demographers who study population growth often use models
similar to ours. In the next section, we'll compare our projections to
theirs.
