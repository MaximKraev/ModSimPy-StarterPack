8.2  Comparing projections {#sec51 .section}
--------------------------

Table 3 from
[[https://modsimpy.com/worldpop]{style="font-family:monospace"}](https://modsimpy.com/worldpop)
contains projections from the U.S. Census and the United Nations DESA:

table3 = tables\[3\]

For some years, one agency or the other has not published a projection,
so some elements of `table3` contain the special value `NaN`, which
stands for "not a number\". `NaN` is often used to indicate missing
data.

Pandas provides functions that deal with missing data, including
`dropna`, which removes any elements in a series that contain `NaN`.
Using `dropna`, we can plot the projections like this:

[]{#hevea_default232} []{#hevea_default233}

def plot\_projections(table): census\_proj = table.census / 1e9 un\_proj
= table.un / 1e9

plot(census\_proj.dropna(), 'b:', label='US Census')
plot(un\_proj.dropna(), 'g--', label='UN DESA')

The format string [`'b:'`]{style="color:#B20000"} indicates a blue
dotted line; `g--` indicates a green dashed line.

[]{#hevea_default234} []{#hevea_default235}

We can run our model over the same interval:

system.t\_end = 2100 results = run\_simulation(system,
update\_func\_quad)

And compare our projections to theirs. Figure [8.2](#chap04-fig02) shows
the results. Real demographers expect world population to grow more
slowly than our model projects, probably because their models are broken
down by region and country, where conditions are different, and they
take into account expected economic development.

[]{#hevea_default236}

Nevertheless, their projections are qualitatively similar to ours, and
theirs differ from each other almost as much as they differ from ours.
So the results from this model, simple as it is, are not entirely crazy.

Before you go on, you might want to read the notebook for this chapter,
`chap08.ipynb`, and work on the exercises. For instructions on
downloading and running the code, see Section [0.4](#code).
