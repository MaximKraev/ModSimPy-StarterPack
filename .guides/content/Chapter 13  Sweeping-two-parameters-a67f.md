Chapter 13  Sweeping two parameters {#sec81 .chapter}
===================================

[]{#chap13}

In the previous chapters I presented an SIR model of infectious disease,
specifically the Kermack-McKendrick model. We extended the model to
include vaccination and the effect of a hand-washing campaign, and used
the extended model to allocate a limited budget optimally, that is, to
minimize the number of infections.

But we assumed that the parameters of the model, contact rate and
recovery rate, were known. In this chapter, we explore the behavior of
the model as we vary these parameters, use analysis to understand these
relationships better, and propose a method for using data to estimate
parameters.
