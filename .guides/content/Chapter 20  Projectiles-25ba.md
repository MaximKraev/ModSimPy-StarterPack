So far the differential equations we've worked with have been [first
order]{style="font-weight:bold"}, which means they involve only first
derivatives. In this chapter, we turn our attention to second order
ODEs, which can involve both first and second derivatives.

We'll revisit the falling penny example from Chapter [1](#chap01), and
use `odeint` to find the position and velocity of the penny as it falls,
with and without air resistance.
