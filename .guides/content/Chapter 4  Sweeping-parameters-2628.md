Chapter 4  Sweeping parameters {#sec29 .chapter}
==============================

[]{#chap04}

In the previous chapter we defined metrics that quantify the performance
of bike sharing this system. In this chapter we see how those metrics
depend on the parameters of the system, like the arrival rate of
customers at bike stations.

We also discuss a program development strategy, called incremental
development, that might help you write programs faster and spend less
time debugging.
