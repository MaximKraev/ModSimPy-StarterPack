Chapter 5  World population {#sec35 .chapter}
===========================

[]{#chap05}

In 1968 Paul Erlich published [The Population
Bomb]{style="font-style:italic"}, in which he predicted that world
population would grow quickly during the 1970s, that agricultural
production could not keep up, and that mass starvation in the next two
decades was inevitable (see
[[https://modsimpy.com/popbomb]{style="font-family:monospace"}](https://modsimpy.com/popbomb)).
As someone who grew up during those decades, I am happy to report that
those predictions were wrong.

But world population growth is still a topic of concern, and it is an
open question how many people the earth can sustain while maintaining
and improving our quality of life.

In this chapter and the next, we use tools from the previous chapters to
explain world population growth since 1950 and generate predictions for
the next 50--100 years.
