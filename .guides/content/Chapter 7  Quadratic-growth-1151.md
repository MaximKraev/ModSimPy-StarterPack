Chapter 7  Quadratic growth {#sec45 .chapter}
===========================

[]{#chap07}

In the previous chapter we developed a population model where net growth
during each time step is proportional to the current population. This
model seems more realistic than the constant growth model, but it does
not fit the data as well.

There are a few things we could try to improve the model:

-   Maybe the net growth rate varies over time.
-   Maybe net growth depends on the current population, but the
    relationship is quadratic, not linear.

In the notebook for this chapter, you will have a chance to try the
first option. In this chapter, we explore the second.
