Chapter 8  Prediction {#sec49 .chapter}
=====================

[]{#chap08}

In the previous chapter we developed a quadratic model of world
population growth from 1950 to 2016. It is a simple model, but it fits
the data well and the mechanisms it's based on are plausible.

In this chapter we'll use the quadratic model to generate projections of
future growth, and compare our results to projections from actual
demographers. Also, we'll represent the models from the previous
chapters as differential equations and solve them analytically.
