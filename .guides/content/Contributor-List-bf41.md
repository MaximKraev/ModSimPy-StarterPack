Contributor List {#sec9 .section}
----------------

If you have a suggestion or correction, send it to
[downey\@allendowney.com]{style="font-family:monospace"}. Or if you are
a Git user, send me a pull request!

If I make a change based on your feedback, I will add you to the
contributor list, unless you ask to be omitted. []{#hevea_default19}

If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that
makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are fine, too,
but not as easy to work with. Thanks!
